<h1>All About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Matthew Popelka, and I am a current senior undergrad student at the University of Nebraska at Omaha
    studying Management Information Systems. My expected graduation date is August 2020. Because I have been a bit
    indecisive when it comes to my future, <abbr title="University of Nebraska at Omaha">UNO</abbr> is my 4th (and final)
    college.</p>
<p>In addition to school, I am an application development intern at Union Pacific Railroad. The experience is proving
to be extremely valuable in figuring out what I want to do post-graduation. My ideal career is one that combines indoor and
    outdoor work, and hands-on and computer work. I am not sure if such a career exists, but that is my goal.</p>
<p>In my free time, I love to do things with my hands and be outside. One thing that separates me from most (but by no
    means all) of my fellow MIS undergrads is my lack of interest in video games. I would much rather be enjoying
    myself outside working on my truck or going fishing at a lake. My fiance has a bit of land near the Elkhorn River
which is perfect for fishing, hunting, and riding 4-wheelers. </p>
